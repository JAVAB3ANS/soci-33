              <p>The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides federal grants to states for supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education for low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and non-breastfeeding postpartum women, as well as infants and children up to the age of five who are nutritionally vulnerable. According to this website, pregnant women, infants, and children from low-income families are at a higher risk of nutritional disease. This demonstrates how difficult it is for low-income individuals to live in desirable conditions due to limitations in food assistance programs, which is highly detrimental to their health and well-being.</p>

              <p>According to WIC's parent site, The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), severe hunger and obesity issues have a negative impact on expecting mothers, infants and children in child care and school, low-income families going to food banks, local farmers markets, and local supermarkets. According to the website, WIC is not an entitlement program because Congress does not set aside funds to allow every eligible individual to participate. WIC is a federal grant program for which Congress appropriates a set amount of money each year to provide supplemental nutritious foods, nutritional education and counseling, and screenings/referrals to other health, welfare, and social services to WIC participants even in changing economic conditions.</p>

              <p>Morals and ethics are the most obvious justifications used, as WIC has a positive impact on learning. Prenatal WIC participation is associated with improved cognitive development and academic performance, according to new research. Children whose mothers participated in WIC while pregnant outperformed similar children whose mothers did not participate on assessments of mental development at age two. Children whose mothers participated in WIC while pregnant performed better on reading assessments, and the benefit lasted into the school years.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <p>The WIC has several different calls to action for what individuals can do to help those who are impacted by obesity and hunger. First, there is a separate link that outlines the current laws and regulations in place to protect future individuals from such conditions. By including these laws and regulations, WIC encourages individuals to fight for people's rights before they are violated, by ensuring that their rights are upheld through documentation. Individuals are encouraged to speak up for themselves and use current laws and regulations to explain their own rights.</p>

              <p>Food purchased with SNAP and WIC must adhere to the same nutritional guidelines established by the Obama administration's Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps) work to alleviate poverty by assisting families in putting food on the table (Dean, 2015). By implementing this plan, the same two programs that were designed to combat poverty and hunger can now help to eliminate childhood obesity. Such a policy may have detractors, as evidenced by Diane Katz's article in the Heritage, in which she opposes a similar policy that imposes censorship on food advertising. According to Katz (2011), proponents argue that they are acting in the best interests of overweight children, and that whether pursuing weight loss or another noble goal, the action is ineffective and likely unconstitutional. It is debatable whether this type of policy is unconstitutional or not, but what cannot be debated is that childhood obesity is at an all-time high. According to the New Medical Association Sport Injuries and Physical Education (2014), 17 percent to 28 percent of all children between the ages of 2 and 19 are obese, which is simply alarming.</p>
