              <p>Childhood obesity in America is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Large corporations have been advertising to children on a daily basis for calorie-dense, un-nutritional foods, snacks, and drinks. They have spent more than $10 billion per year on children and teenagers. Excessive television viewing is a major contributor to childhood and adolescent obesity. Excessive television viewing increases food consumption while decreasing physical activity. The government has already limited the amount of advertising these companies can do to children. Government regulations will not end America's obesity epidemic. These regulations have currently been shown to be ineffective. We need to change our approach and teach our children about the dangers of fast food and an unhealthy diet. In an ideal world, corporations would be required to adjust their operations.</p><br>
              <p>If the information provided is insufficient, perhaps it is time for the government and the food industry to work together to reduce the need for consumers to read and research everything they put into their bodies. Companies that supply food should be open about what they provide to their customers. More importantly, I believe it would be advantageous for these companies to simply create better products without being asked. More research into the creation of our food and how we can make it taste the same with healthier ingredients will allow us to save money on health care costs globally. This means that large corporations will have to contribute less money to assist their employees, who are also consumers. This means that they will pay less for sick leave because their employees are healthy and do not need it. This also means spending less money to train new employees when their current ones pass away from heart attacks or diabetes-related kidney damage.</p><br>
              <p>The sacrifice would not be necessary if health foods were more affordable and widely available. In conclusion, given all of the complications associated with obesity, packaged food companies must make nationwide changes, and perhaps even increase the number of local farms. A decrease in the price of fruits and vegetables would also be beneficial.</p>
