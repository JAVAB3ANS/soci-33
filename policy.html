                <li><p>It was created to assist in meeting the healthy dietary needs of children in the United States. The Breakfast Initiative was established by the Act. The program was a federal state food program that provided low-cost or free meals to children in nonprofit schools, childcare facilities, and public schools. The purpose of this paper is to go over the history of the Act, the problems that led to its implementation, and the major ideological assumptions in the policy. In recent years, more than 90,000 schools/institutions serve schoolbreakfasts to 14.77 million students each day.</p></li><br>
                <li><p>It improved academic performance because nutrition is critical for students' concentration in class. It reduced childhood hunger and behavioral issues because school lunches can help fill in the gaps that many children miss at home.</p></li>  <br>
                <li><p>Because schools lack the funding to improve their food conditions, the quality of the school food may be subpar. Many school lunches are a total waste because some students do not finish their meals. Finally, studies have shown that students who eat hot lunches on a regular basis are more likely to be overweight and obese than students who bring their lunches.</p></li><br>

              <p>The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 authorizes funding for federal school meal and child nutrition programs while also increasing low-income children's access to healthy food. The bill that reauthorizes these programs is commonly abbreviated as the child nutrition reauthorization bill. The federal government has made great efforts in trying to improve the diets of our school aged children by implementing the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010. The program ensures both school breakfast and lunch served to children are healthier than before by ushering in new updated nutrition standards. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in New York City has gotten into the act by launching a "Healthy Bodegas" initiative which aims at encouraging neighborhood convenience stores to sell more nutritious food.</p>

                <li><p>The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 improved nutrition standards for meals and beverages served through the National School Lunch, Breakfast, and Smart Snacks Programs, which serve fifty million children daily at 99,000 schools. The National School Lunch Act (NSLA) mandates that school meals follow the most recent "Dietary Guidelines for Americans." Furthermore, HHFKA provision 201 amended the NSLA to require the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to update menu planning and nutrition standards for school meals based on current science. Millions of children across the country eat school meals every day, so ensuring that these meals provide healthy options and can help teach balanced eating is an important way to impact childhood obesity and the associated health risks. Apparently, more than 16 million children live in food-insecure households, and school meals can be an important source of nutrition for them.</p></li>
                <br>
                <li><p>Many of the key provisions of the HHFKA that directly affect the school lunch program went into effect on July 1, 2012. These included a number of program administration provisions aimed at improving access to nutritious meals for low-income students, as well as new menu planning requirements and nutrition standards for school lunches. Changes to the breakfast program requirements and other administrative changes took effect on July 1, 2013 and will be in effect until July 1, 2014.</p></li>

                <li><p>The most recent CNR was the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, though some of its provisions expired on September 30, 2015. However, most nutrition programs continue to operate due to continued funding provided by Congress through appropriations acts. This allows programs to continue despite the delay in reauthorization. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, among other things, established the Community Eligibility Provision, a provision within the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program that allowed certain eligible schools to provide free meals to all students. The law also required the USDA to update school meal nutrition standards.</p></li>
