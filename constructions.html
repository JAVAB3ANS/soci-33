              <p>Obesity both in the United States and the United Kingdom is a major public health crisis. Policies that incentivize, coerce, or punish are a great way to help reduce the rapid increase in obesity. An incentive is something that might motivate a person to change their habits. A coerce is persuasion by using threats or forcing an individual who is not willing to change their habits. Lastly, punishment is a sanction for doing wrong, to make up for what has been done. Genetics, lack of physical activity, and food consumptions are some of the main causes of obesity. With the rapid growth of the number of people being obese, public health professionals need to help prevent the increase, as many health risks come with obesity.</p><br>
              <p>A study shows that by the year 2030, it is projected that there will be about 65 million more obese people in the United States, and about 11 million more obese people in the United Kingdom1 . The only way public health professionals and the government will be able to attempt to prevent this public health crisis is by using an incentive approach. One example of an incentive approach to reduce child obesity by a financial incentive program. Families will have two options, Reward A, which is starting off with nothing, or Reward B, which is starting off with $430 worth of points. If a family chooses Reward A, the person will gain points for every goal they meet, with a reward of up to $290 worth of points. If a family chooses Reward B, the person will start with $430 worth of points and lose points when they do not meet their goal2 . With that being said, when talking about the public health crisis of obesity, coercing or punishing is a valid approach as it is not as motivating as incentives might be. One example of coercion that might be beneficial to the public health crisis of obesity is using a scaring tactic of the health risks that come with obesity, which might persuade people enough to change their habits. Lastly, one example of punishment to reduce obesity is by increasing health care prices for those who will not do anything to help themselves.</p><br>
              <p>The NHS has a health spending of Â£201.7 billion in 2020/21, which is about $244.8 billion. With that being said, there is technically plenty of money to incentivize those who live in the United Kingdom. If 11 million people are being incentivized, to lose weight, and each person is given $1,000, then there will still be $244.7 for health spending. Additionally, if this incentive works, theoretically fewer people will need to receive health care for the health risks that are caused by obesity. While the NHS has quite a bit of money that could be spent on procedures to help reduce obesity, they have been reluctant to allow these procedures as the patient would need to lose weight prior to the surgery3 . Additionally, by restricting the number of elective procedures, NHS is saving money.</p><br>
              <p>The number of obese people needs to decrease drastically. While different tactics work for different people, it is very important to encourage and support those who are working hard to maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle. With that being said, each policy might work differently for every person. If both public health professionals and governments work hard to reduce the public health crisis of obesity, a change can be made.</p>
