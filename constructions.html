              <p>Obesity is a major public health problem in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Policies that incentivize, coerce, or punish are an excellent way to combat the rapid rise in obesity. An incentive is something that can persuade someone to change their habits. A coerce is the use of threats or force to persuade someone who is unwilling to change their habits. Finally, punishment is a sanction for wrongdoing in order to make amends. Obesity is caused primarily by genetics, a lack of physical activity, and food consumption. With the rapid increase in the number of obese people, public health professionals must help prevent the increase, as obesity poses numerous health risks.</p><br>
              <p>According to one study, by 2030, there will be approximately 65 million more obese people in the United States and approximately 11 million more obese people in the United Kingdom<sup>1</sup>. Only by using an incentive approach will public health professionals and the government be able to attempt to prevent this public health crisis. A financial incentive program is one example of an incentive approach to reducing child obesity. Families will have two options: Reward A, which starts with nothing, or Reward B, which starts with $430 in points. If a family selects Reward A, the person will earn points for each goal they complete, with a maximum reward of $290. If a family selects Reward B, the individual will begin with $430 in points and will lose points if they do not meet their goal<sup>2</sup>. Having said that, when it comes to the public health crisis of obesity, coercion or punishment is a valid approach because incentives are not as motivating. One example of coercion that may be beneficial to the public health crisis of obesity is scaring people about the health risks associated with obesity in order to persuade them to change their habits. Finally, one example of punishment for obesity is raising health-care costs for those who refuse to help themselves.</p><br>
              <p>In 2020/21, the NHS will spend Â£201.7 billion on health, which is approximately $244.8 billion. Having said that, there is technically plenty of money available to incentivize those who live in the United Kingdom. If 11 million people are encouraged to lose weight and each receives $1,000, there will still be $244.7 for health-care spending. Furthermore, if this incentive is successful, fewer people will need to seek medical attention for the health risks associated with obesity. While the NHS has a lot of money to spend on procedures to help reduce obesity, they have been hesitant to allow these procedures because the patient would need to lose weight before the surgery<sup>3</sup>. Furthermore, by limiting the number of elective procedures, the NHS saves money.</p><br>
              <p>The number of obese people must be drastically reduced. While different strategies work for different people, it is critical to encourage and support those who are striving to maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle. That being said, each policy may work differently for each individual. Change is possible if both public health professionals and governments work hard to reduce the public health crisis of obesity.</p>
