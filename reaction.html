              <p>Health policy experts have issued a warning about the potential health and economic consequences of rising obesity rates in the United States. Obesity, despite this, has only recently gained political prominence in the United States, and little is known about what ordinary Americans think about obesity or whether they support obesity-related legislation. This study investigates public attitudes toward obesity and obesity policy using unique survey data obtained by the authors. Contrary to popular belief, most Americans are unconcerned about obesity, support few obesity-related initiatives, and continue to believe that obesity is caused by individual failure rather than environmental or inherited factors.</p><br>  
              <p>Given the scarcity of elite discourse on obesity policy, we show that traditional policy drivers such as ideology or partisanship are poor predictors of attitudes toward obesity policy. People use other attitudinal frameworks, such as their views on smoking regulation and environmental accountability, when it comes to a low-valence problem like obesity. The implications of these findings for obesity policy and public opinion polling are discussed.</p>
              <br>
              <p>According to the CDC, 42.5 percent of adults aged 20 and up in the United States were obese in 2018. (CDC, 2018). Nonetheless, the media continues to portray obesity negatively. The majority of overweight or obese characters are portrayed as lazy, unattractive, and constantly eating or talking about food. They are also rarely seen in romantic relationships, which gave rise to the term "Fattertainment."</p>

              <p>The issue of obesity representation in the media has an impact on the audience because it demonstrates how the media has continued to portray obese people in negative and inaccurate ways. These negative portrayals have been dubbed "fattertainment," which refers to the negative and stereotypical portrayal of overweight or obese people in the media (Heuer, 2010).</p><br>
              <p>Researchers have attempted to document what is known as "weight bias in the media." According to studies of primetime television shows and movies, overweight female characters are frequently teased and insulted by male characters, which is followed by audience laughter.</p><br>
              <p>Even children's television shows and movies send out negative messages about being overweight. According to research, overweight cartoon characters are typically portrayed as unattractive, unintelligent, unhappy, and cruel. At least one obese character is disliked in 40% of children's movies, and a character with obesity is shown thinking about or eating food in more than half of children's movies.</p><br>
              <p>Unfortunately, fat humor and "fattertainment" have an equally negative impact on public perceptions of obese people. Many Americans may believe that making fun of obese people is not only acceptable, but also beneficial because it provides motivation to lose weight. However, research indicates that this is not the case. Obese people suffer from weight bias in a variety of ways. Obese people who experience weight bias may become depressed, anxious, and have low self-esteem, according to research.</p>
