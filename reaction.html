              <p>Experts in health policy have issued a warning about the potential health and economic consequences of growing obesity rates in the United States. Despite this, obesity has only lately gained political prominence in the United States, and little is known about what ordinary Americans think about obesity or whether they favor obesity-related legislation. Using unique survey data obtained by the authors, this research explores public attitudes of obesity and obesity policy. Contrary to common assumption, most Americans are indifferent about obesity, have little support for obesity-related efforts, and continue to assume that obesity is caused by individual failure rather than environmental or inherited causes.</p><br>  
              <p>Given the paucity of elite discourse on obesity policy, we also show that typical drivers of policy preferences, such as ideology or partisanship, are not good predictors of attitudes on obesity policy. People instead employ other attitudinal frameworks, such as their opinions on smoking regulation and environmental accountability, when it comes to a low-valence problem like obesity. These findings are discussed in the context of obesity policy and public opinion research.</p>
              <br>
              <p>In 2018 the CDC reported 42.5% of adults 20 years and older in the US were considered obese (CDC, 2018). Yet the representation of obesity in the media remains negative. With most characters overweight or obese characters being shown as lazy, unattractive, and always eating or talking about food. They also rarely get shown in romantic relationships coining a new term "Fattertainment".</p>

              div.content {
                text-align: left;
              }

            <div class="content">
              <p>The issue of representation of obesity in the media impacts the audience because it shows how the media continued to display negative and inaccurate portrayals of obese people. These negative portrayals has been commonly called “fattertainment,” which is the negative and stereotypical depiction of overweight or obese people in the media (Heuer, 2010).</p><br>
              <p>Researchers have attempted to document this trend commonly referred to as “weight bias in the media.” Studies have analyzed primetime television shows and movies and found that overweight female characters are often teased and insulted by male characters, which is followed by audience laughter.</p><br>
              <p>Even children’s programs and movies communicate negative messages about being overweight. Studies show that overweight cartoon characters are typically depicted as unattractive, unintelligent, unhappy and cruel. In 40% of children’s movies, at least one character with obesity is disliked, and in over half of children’s movies, a character with obesity is shown thinking about or eating food.</p><br>
              <p>Unfortunately, fat humor and “fattertainment” have an equally unfavorable impact on public perceptions about people with obesity. Many Americans may somehow feel that making fun of people with obesity is not only justifiable, but also beneficial, because it provides motivation to lose weight. Research, however, tells us that this isn’t true. Weight bias is damaging to people with obesity in many ways. Studies show that people with obesity who experience weight bias may become depressed, anxious and have low self-esteem.</p>
