              <p>In February 2010, James Oliver, an experienced chef, activist, and Member of the British Empire (MBE), delivered a TED talk titled "Teach Every Kid About Food." "People now aren't telling the truth about the elements in a meal like a simple hamburger," Oliver claims." Children are not taught cooking skills and have little to no knowledge of food or nutrition facts.</p>

              <p>People have gradually stopped caring about what they put in their bodies and what their children eat over the last decade. People nowadays eat for pleasure and only eat food that tastes good, when they should be eating food that is healthier and gives them more energy. Many places around the world have little knowledge of what goes into their meals, particularly fast food. Even schools, which are a major source of food for children, serve highly processed and unhealthy foods to their students. To support the idea of making school lunches healthier for students, schools today only offer intense carbohydrates and processed fruits.</p>

              <p>He is very effective when he shows statistics about obesity and how diet disease is the most serious problem in the United States, as well as how many people have died from it. When he shows the video clip of him talking to a mother about how she feeds her children, he wants to give one example of what is happening in many other families across the country. The video of him at a school shows how little knowledge kids have about food and what schools should do to help improve their food knowledge, and he connects with the audience by telling them he's also a father. Jamie Oliver's "bigger picture" goal is for schools to change how they handle what they feed their students and what they need to learn about their diets for their futures. He also wants parents to be more concerned about their children's health and not lead them down the same path that they did as children.</p><br>
              <p>Jamie Oliver's "bigger picture" goal is for schools to change how they handle what they feed their students and what they need to learn about their diets for their futures. He also wants parents to be more concerned about their children's health and not lead them down the same path that they did as children. The graph illustrates to the audience how serious the problem of obesity and heart disease is. He provides another statistic about our health-care costs, stating, "Obesity costs you Americans 10% of your healthcare bills, or $150 billion per year." It is expected to double in the next ten years." Both of these statistics show that obesity and unhealthy food can have a negative impact on our bodies as well as our finances.</p><br>
              <p>Schools play a significant role in this problem because they do not assist students in improving their diet, which leads to bad habits and obesity. The main reason for this is that schools do not teach their students about food and how to improve their diets. Jamie Oliver uses a video in which he visits an elementary school and asks different children if they can name different vegetables such as tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, and so on. Each child he asked had no idea what vegetables he was showing them, demonstrating their ignorance. This demonstrates that they were never taught to differentiate between foods. This can lead to bad habits at home, and they don't care what kind of bad food they feed their bodies. All of these examples demonstrate how inadequate schools and the education system are at teaching their students how to live a healthier lifestyle and preparing them for life on their own. If schools do not change their approach to this problem, kids will not change how they eat in the future, and there will be a lot more students who will live an unhealthy lifestyle and have no knowledge of what they eat.</p><br>
              <p>Oliver employs a variety of visuals of real families and people to show his audience real-life situations from across the country. He first introduces Stacy and her family in a video. Stacy was never taught to cook and never lived a healthy lifestyle, which resulted in her own children becoming obese at a young age. This demonstrates how obesity can affect your entire family if bad habits are not changed early in life, and it can even lead to death. He also displays a photograph of Brittany, his 16-year-old friend. She has only six years to live as a result of the food she has consumed throughout her life. Brittany, like Stacy, grew up in a home where she was not taught to cook for herself. Marissa is another person Jamie introduces; she isn't obese, but her family has a history of obesity. Her father and uncle were both obese and died as a result of their obesity, and her stepfather is now obese. Jamie Oliver wants the audience to understand that obesity affects more than just the person who is obese. He tells these stories to show the audience what can happen if they don't pay attention and learn what they put in their bodies.</p>

              div.content {
                text-align: left;

              <p>Obesity is caused by a variety of factors, the most significant of which are found on Main Street, in schools, and at home. Fast food has only gotten worse over the years; it used to be fresh local food, but now it's all processed and loaded with extra ingredients. Jamie Oliver proposes a solution in which the government can assist in reducing the excessive amounts of fat and sugar in fast food over the next 5-7 years. Oliver proposes that foods in schools be more fresh rather than highly processed, and that the education system be more strict about teaching students about food and their health. Parents must teach their children to cook and to live a healthy lifestyle before they leave home. All of these solutions can be stated on paper, but it will take the collective efforts of the entire country to effect change over the next few years.</p><br>
              <p>Overall, Jamie Oliver makes a compelling argument and employs a variety of strategies such as ethos, pathos, logos, and visuals to persuade and entertain his audience. He used numerous examples, personal experiences, and the audience during his speech to help build his argument. The only issue with everything he's talking about is putting everything into action to make it better; it's much easier to say everything on paper, but it's far more difficult to put those solutions into action. The only simple solutions would be for schools to improve their food education and for parents to teach their children how to cook. It has the potential to reduce heart disease deaths and the number of obese people in the future.</p>
