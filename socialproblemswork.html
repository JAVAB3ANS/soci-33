              <p>There are several different social problems workers that are involved in the decisions made for parents of children with obesity, the children themselves, and the social network or society in which they live and learn, that affect their everyday capabilities. In order to understand how different groups affect the institutional challenges that parents face in trying to raise their child with obesity, it is important to acknowledge the interactions between these different people in power and how their actions change the everyday lived experiences of parents and children. The professional social problems workers associated with children with obesity, and consequently, their parents are: teachers, doctors, superintendents, and social workers.</p>

                Every child who attends school requires a positive parent-teacher relationship. However, it is especially important to establish a strong relationship for children with obesity, due to the child's needs that must be met both at home and at school. Because children spend at least half, if not the majority, of their time at school, the teacher can detect changes in the child. Between the children and the teacher, a close and deep relationship dynamic is established. This empowers the teacher to determine whether or not there is a problem and the magnitude of the problem. They can express concerns to parents and collaborate with them to identify the root causes of problems. The relationship between the teacher and the parent is also important. This relationship assists parents in determining whether something is a problem and how to address it. Teachers can also raise concerns with insider claimmakers. Because they are able to draw attention to the problem, they, along with teachers, begin to construct the conditions' grounds, warrants, and conclusions. However, as teachers, they are limited in their ability to effect change on their own. They can communicate issues, but they cannot effect institutional changes to assist parents. Teachers are generally underpaid for their efforts. They frequently work outside of the classroom to meet the needs and deadlines of their students, but they are rarely compensated for doing so. They are also underpaid, but they have the ability to influence the school board and other professionals in the school system to enact change by leveraging their own position of power as well as the expert experiences they have (including the parent's). As previously stated, the power dynamics between a teacher and a parent help to generate more momentum when attempting to get action for the challenges that parents face. Teachers collaborate with parents to effect change where it is needed.

                Doctors, like teachers, have the authority to determine whether a condition is a problem. Doctors, for example, are the people who make the initial diagnosis or refer children to a center where they will be evaluated for obesity by a specialist. Although they are not the actual specialists making the diagnosis, they are experts in recognizing the child's condition and determining whether or not they should be evaluated. Following the diagnosis, the doctor collaborates with the parent to identify the challenges and hardships that the parents and child face as a result of the diagnosis. This demonstrates the authority that doctors have in determining whether a condition is a problem and how serious it is. Doctors can identify and claim that there is a problem that parents are facing by constructing the grounds. They use medical warrants to explain the scope of the problem and may even refer parents to social groups or other resources for themselves in order to seek support as a parent of an obese child. Asking parents to help with their children's problems gives doctors the authority to draw conclusions about their problems. As a medical professional, it is customary in our society to take medical advice very seriously. Doctors are generally well compensated, and because of their power and knowledge in our society, they can influence many different groups of people. Parents and policymakers are examples of those who can effect change. Doctors have the ability to bring about change from within.

                Superintendents are in charge of multiple schools in a geographical area, and by being exposed to the issues and problems of each, they can identify systematic patterns that need to be addressed and bring them to the attention of their government. Having a well-respected position and being exposed to more schools gives them a better understanding of problems in the education system and allows them to construct their grounds, warrants, and conclusions in a position where their job is to ensure student success within their schools. Their ideas are influential in creating changes within the school system because they represent the schools they represent in local government.

                Social workers engage with and interact with students from disadvantaged backgrounds to gain an understanding of the realities and depth of the inequalities they face. Furthermore, if they work with more than one child, they gain insight into the complexities that accumulate in the lives of schoolchildren as a result of the unique challenges that are systematically imposed on them. Social workers are also a first point of contact for reporting problems and raising awareness of concerning conditions in the lives of children, as well as providing support for them, so that when constructing grounds, warrants, and conclusions, they can draw from the experiences of the children with whom they work.
