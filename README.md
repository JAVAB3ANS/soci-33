- A repository for hosting and storing my social injustice website's source code for my **SOCI 33: Social Problems in the U.S.** course. 

- It covers and provides an overview of contemporary social problems in the United States from a sociological perspective, with a major emphasis on the ways race, class, and gender shape the development of specific social problems and the public policies offered to address them. 

- Topics may include the economy, poverty, homelessness, and social inequality.
